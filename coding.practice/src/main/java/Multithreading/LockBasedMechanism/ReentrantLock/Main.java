//    [1749540413947] Lock acquired by Thread-1
//    [1749540413947] Lock released by Thread-0
//    [1749540417951] Lock released by Thread-1

//    Thread-1 does not acquire the lock until exactly when Thread-0 releases it.
//    Both "acquired" and "released" logs happen at the same millisecond,
//    which is why it looks suspicious, but itâ€™s just timing coincidence, not a bug.
