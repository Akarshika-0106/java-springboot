Smallest subarray containing minimum and maximum values
Given an array A of size N.
The task is to find the length of smallest subarray which contains both maximum and minimum values.

Examples:

Input : A[] = {1, 5, 9, 7, 1, 9, 4}
Output : 2
subarray {1, 9} has both maximum and minimum value.

Input : A[] = {2, 2, 2, 2}
Output : 1
2 is both maximum and minimum here.
